## <a href="https://pablolucianop.github.io/endlessTriangle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DEMO Endless Triangle</a>


This is a js version of 'the game of chaos' proposed in the book 'Randomness in everyday life' by Alberto Rojo. The source code is written as a step by step demonstration. 

 The instructions are:
* 1 define a triangle
* 2 pick the a random 'First Point', inside this triangle.
* 3 pick a random vertex of the triangle previously defined
* 4 find the middle point between the chosen vertex and that 'First Point', and push it into an array
* 5 define the middle the point between the point defined before and a random vertex of our triangle, and draw this point
* 6 repeat a lot of times
