*Elements arranged by golden ratio spiral


* This is a js version of 'the game of chaos' proposed in the book 'Randomness in everyday life' by Alberto Rojo. The source code is written as a step by step demonstration. 

* The instructions are:
* 1 define a triangle

* 2 pick the a random 'First Point', inside this triangle.

* 3 pick a random vertex of the triangle previously defined

* 4 find the middle point between the chosen vertex and that 'First Point', and push it into an array

* 5 define the middle the point between the point defined before and a random vertex of our triangle, and draw this point

* 6 repeat a lot of times
